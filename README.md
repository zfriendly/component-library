# Component Library

Building a component library from an Adobe XD mock-up using React.

# Component Library Project Requirements

- Build out a component library using React and Storybook. The component library should be deployed tto GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Surge and published to the NPM Package registry.

- The component library should include all of the components in the Adobe XD mockup.

### Technical Requirements

- Project should meet the following requirements:
  - Runs without errors
  - Include the required components in the Adobe XD Mock-up
  - Be deployed to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Surge
  - Be published to the NPM Package Registry
  - Shows a good commit history with frequent commits.

## Prerequisites

- React and Components
- Storybook
- Adobe XD

## My Process

1. Wrote out all of the different variations of the components I would need for the buttons and forms.
   - Eg. Faded, Outline, Hover, etc.
2. Built the default buttons, adding each type (Warning, Success, etc.) as I went along.
3. Added the different props, such as 'large' or 'outline'
4. Imported and styled the icons to work for the cart and heart buttons.
5. Built as much as I could using functional components, then used class components for the counter, the input + button forms, and the checkboxes.
6. Researched custom styling for select boxes and checkboxes.
7. Applied new styles to all of the forms.

## Deployed with:

I used Netlify to host my site, which can be found [**HERE**](https://zack-component-storybook.netlify.com/?path=/story/button--primary).

## Contributing/Future Additions

Feel free to find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/zfriendly) if you're interested in contributing. I had a couple of things I wanted to work on moving forward:

1. Getting better at manipulating the state in class components, rather than relying on functional components.
2. Writing better DRY code.
3. Using onClick and onChange functions in the class components.
4. Adding the product details bonus.
